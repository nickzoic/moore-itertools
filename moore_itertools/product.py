def product(gen1, gen2):
    """Return the cartesian product of two generators, gen1 and gen2,
    in such a way that either or both can be infinite, or at least very large.

    Values from the generators are memoized until they are no longer needed.
    This is good for expensive generators, if your generation is cheap there's
    better ways.

    Results are yielded in an arbitrary order:

    >>> sorted(list(product(iter('abc'), iter('1234'))))  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [('a', '1'), ('a', '2'), ('a', '3'), ('a', '4'),
    ('b', '1'), ('b', '2'), ('b', '3'), ('b', '4'),
    ('c', '1'), ('c', '2'), ('c', '3'), ('c', '4')]

    Having infinite generators as inputs, even as both inputs, is fine so long
    as you can handle infinite output:

    >>> from itertools import count, islice
    >>> len(list(islice(product(count(0),count(0)), 1000000)))
    1000000

    Empty iterators do what you'd expect, even with infinite generators:

    >>> list(product(iter([]), count(0)))
    []
